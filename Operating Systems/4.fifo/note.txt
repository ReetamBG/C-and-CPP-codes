FIRST IN FIRST OUT

# mkfifo is used to make a special first in first out file, called pipe which is used to communicate between different proesses
# The sender and reciever will communicate through a unique file called fifo which acts as a buffer
# Both the sender and reciever must run together for this to work
# As soon as both the sender and reciever starts running simulatneously (in different terminals) their code starts executing 
# NOTE - the fifo file has to be created freshly for every execution

Assignment
Make a two processes that will communicate with each other
One file will act as the sender and the other as a reciever, in the next turn the other file will act as the sender and the reciever as the sender
Basically like a chat system with only one message from each side untill response from other side
NOTE - Do not use sleep or wait
