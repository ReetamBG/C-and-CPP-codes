PIPE

# a pipe is used to communicate between the parent and the child process

WRITE and READ

# used to read and write through a file or a buffer
# note that the read statement will keep on waiting for data from the write statement unless its obtained
# when we write data and then read it using the same file descriptor then the read catches the data and stores it otherwise it keeps waiting unless it recieves data
